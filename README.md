# Analysis trending advertising videos on Youtube 

*The analytical task and dataset used in this project are dummies. The project was created exclusively for practice.*

This project was created for an ad agency to analyze popular YouTube videos and determine what content deserves marketing attention.
The interactive dashboard is made with Jupyter and Tableau and answers questions: 
* Which video categories trended most often?
* How were they distributed among regions?
* What categories were especially popular? 
* Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?

The project consists of 3 parts:

* Project Implementation
* Project Infographic
* Project Dashboard

**Project Dashboard** is published on Tableau Public. [Link to the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/aliona808#!/vizhome/VideoTrendsonYouTube/VideoTrendsonYouTubeNov2017-Jun2018)

**Please, pay attention:**

Sometimes GitHub fails to render the *.ipynb notebooks and you get the message *"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"*, etc when trying to view a *.ipynb on a GitHub page. In this case, [you can use a workaround.](https://github.com/Aliona88/analysis_trending_advertising_videos/blob/master/if_notebook_not_loaded.md#a-workaround)
