# Analysis trending advertising videos on Youtube* 

This project was created for an ad agency to analyze popular YouTube videos and determine what content deserves marketing attention.
The interactive dashboard is made with Jupyter and Tableau and answers questions: 
* Which video categories trended most often?
* How were they distributed among regions?
* What categories were especially popular? 
* Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?

The project consists of 3 parts:

* Project Implementation
* Project Dashboard
* Project Infographic

**Project Dashboard** is published on Tableau Public. [Link to the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/aliona808#!/vizhome/VideoTrendsonYouTube/VideoTrendsonYouTubeNov2017-Jun2018)

**Project Infographic** is published on Google Drive. [Link to the presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hb2xg6HP2LvST52AUgo4wopbLhb_fo_k/view?usp=sharing)

To run the pipeline script:

**Please, pay attention:**

Sometimes GitHub fails to render the *.ipynb notebooks and you get the message *"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"*, etc when trying to view a *.ipynb on a GitHub page. In this case, [you can use a workaround.](https://github.com/Aliona88/analysis_trending_advertising_videos/blob/master/if_notebook_not_loaded.md#a-workaround)

* The project was created for practice.
