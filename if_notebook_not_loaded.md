Sometimes GitHub fails to render the *.ipynb notebooks and you get the message *"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"* when trying to view a *.ipynb on a GitHub page.

## A workaround

1. Open the page of notebook that you want to view on GitHub:

For example:

https://github.com/Aliona88/analysis_trending_advertising_videos/blob/master/analysis_trending_advertising_videos.ipynb

2. Copy the link of this notebook and past it to the notebook viewer [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

You don't need to install it!

3. Then you get https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Aliona88/analysis_trending_advertising_videos/blob/master/analysis_trending_advertising_videos.ipynb

The site nbviewer works independently of github.
